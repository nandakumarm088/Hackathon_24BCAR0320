Overview
This project is an AI-powered smart home assistant that allows users to control smart home devices (e.g., lights, AC, heaters) using voice commands or text input. The assistant leverages Google Dialogflow for natural language understanding and Python for backend logic. The user interface is built using Tkinter, and the assistant supports both text-to-speech and speech-to-text functionalities.

The assistant can:
•	Turn devices ON/OFF.
•	Adjust temperature for devices like AC and heaters.
•	Add or remove devices dynamically.
•	Provide real-time feedback through a graphical interface.

Supported Commands
Here are some examples of commands you can use:
•	Turn devices ON/OFF:
o	"Turn on the light."
o	"Turn off the AC."
•	Set temperature:
o	"Set the AC to 22 degrees."
o	"Increase the heater temperature by 3 degrees."
o	"Decrease the AC temperature by 2 degrees."
How to use: 
•	Click the "Speak" button to use voice commands.
•	Use the text input box to use text-based commands.
•	Can add devices (e.g., "light," " AC", “Fan”)  using the Add device box and button.
