**Overview**

This project is an AI-powered smart home assistant that allows users to control smart home devices (e.g., lights, AC, heaters) using voice commands or text input. The assistant leverages Google Dialogflow for natural language understanding and Python for backend logic. The user interface is built using Tkinter, and the assistant supports both text-to-speech and speech-to-text functionalities.

**The assistant can:**

•	Turn devices ON/OFF.

•	Adjust temperature for devices like AC and heaters.

•	Add or remove devices dynamically.

•	Provide real-time feedback through a graphical interface.
